**!!! UNDER CONSTRUCTION !!!**

## ch4

*rsdns* comes with a small command-line tool [ch4](https://github.com/r-bk/ch4).
*ch4* uses *rsdns* to query the Domain Name System,
and shows the results in a simple format.
It can be used as a simple substitute to [dig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_(command)),
especially on platforms where *dig* is not natively supported.
